# Additional Documentation for Concrete Operators Module

## Overview
The `concrete-operators` module serves as an AI Agent Orchestration Platform, designed to facilitate the management and coordination of AI agents in various applications. This module is built with a focus on extensibility and integration with popular libraries and frameworks.

## Features
- **AI Agent Management**: Provides tools for orchestrating multiple AI agents, allowing for complex workflows and interactions.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: Utilizes the OpenAI API for advanced AI functionalities.
- **Database Support**: Leverages SQLAlchemy and SQLModel for robust database interactions, supporting various database backends.
- **Asynchronous Task Management**: Implements Celery for handling background tasks and scheduling.

## Installation
To install the `concrete-operators` module, ensure you have Python 3.11.9 or higher, and use the following command:
```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage
After installation, you can import the module and start orchestrating your AI agents. Refer to the README.md for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Dependency Groups
- **Tool Use Dependencies**: Includes libraries such as `boto3` for AWS integration, `matplotlib` for data visualization, and `networkx` for graph-based data structures.
- **Development Dependencies**: Tools for code quality and development workflow, including `black`, `flake8`, and `mypy`.
- **Web Application Dependencies**: Frameworks and servers like `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for building web applications.
- **Documentation Dependencies**: `mkdocs-material` for generating project documentation.
- **Daemon Dependencies**: Libraries for handling JWT and cryptography tasks.
- **Testing Dependencies**: `pytest` for running tests and ensuring code quality.

## Security Analysis
The module includes a configuration for Bandit, a security linter for Python, which helps identify potential security issues in the codebase. The configuration specifies directories to exclude from analysis and lists specific tests to run or skip.

## Contribution
Contributions to the `concrete-operators` module are welcome. Please refer to the contribution guidelines in the README.md for more information on how to get involved.
