            <h1>Why the name Abstract Operators?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In computer science, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)" style="color: #e4e400;">operator</a> is something that interacts with an input that precedes and/or follows it, like the plus sign + will add the two numbers it's between. An abstract object (similar to an interface) is a partial definition that is meant to be completed at a later time rather than used directly. Thus, an abstract operator is a placeholder actor that will be given meaning at a later time based on context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In business, an operator is a person that runs a business, usually in a financial or operational capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tool use or function calling is an important feature of AI agents. We build infrastructure for agents that are operators of tools like search, browsers, and other agents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The humans of abstract operators are the operators of agents, bringing them to market to serve and delight our enterprise customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are wielders (operators) of abstraction to make conceptual frameworks work for us by expressing them through multiagent systems.
