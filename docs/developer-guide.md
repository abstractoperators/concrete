# Developer Guide
## Setup
### Pyenv
Pyenv allows you to manage multiple versions of Python on your computer. It can configure a default Python version globally or on a directory basis.

```shell
curl https://pyenv.run | bash  # to install Pyenv

echo -e 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"\nexport PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"\n eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc  # to set up environment variables

exec "$SHELL"  # restarts the terminal shell process

pyenv â€“version  # to confirm Pyenv has installed successfully

pyenv install 3.11.9  # to install Python 3.11.9

pyenv global 3.11.9

# Alternatively, to set in a particular directory where the projects will be built
# cd /Users/personmcpersonsonson/git/concreteproject
# pyenv local 3.11.9
```

### Poetry
Concrete uses poetry for dependency management and environment isolation.

```shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# By default, poetry as a command should be accessible.
# If not, add it to your path

# For mac
# echo -e 'export PATH="~/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/venv/bin/poetry:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## SQL Alchemy

SQLAlchemy is an SQL toolkit and ORM library for Python. We use it in concrete to persist.

## Defining a Construct
Use base class defined in `concrete.orm.models` to define a construct.

```python
from concrete.orm.models import Base

class my_table(Base):
    __tablename__ = "my_table" # Unnecessary; defaults to class_name.lower()
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) # Unnecessary; defaults to autoincrementing id

    # Columns
    my_column: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(32))
```

## DB Operations
Use `concrete.db.orm.SessionLocal` to get a session. 
Use this session to perform DB operations. Best practice is to use one session per one transaction. By default, sessions will not flush or commit.

```python
from concrete.db.orm import SessionLocal

# The following solutions achieve the same thing, but with different approaches
# ORM Centric solution

def delete_my_table_orm():
    session = SessionLocal()
    deleted_count = session.query(my_table).filter(my_column == 'my_value').delete()
    session.commit()
    return deleted_count

def delete_my_table_core():
    session = SessionLocal()
    stmt = delete(my_table).where(my_column == 'my_value')
    result = session.execute(stmt)
    deleted_count = result.rowcount
    session.commit()
    return deleted_count
```

## Overview
This module is responsible for managing the database connection and session handling using SQLAlchemy and SQLModel. It provides a context manager for session management and establishes a connection to the database defined in the environment variables.

## Environment Configuration
The database connection URL is loaded from the environment variable `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`. If this variable is not set, it defaults to using a SQLite database located at `sql_app.db`.

### Loading Environment Variables
To load environment variables from a `.env` file, the `dotenv` package is used. Ensure that the `.env` file is present in the project root with the necessary configuration.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

## Database Engine
The database engine is created using SQLModel's `create_engine` function. It supports both SQLite and other databases, with specific connection arguments for SQLite to allow multi-threaded access.

```python
from sqlmodel import create_engine

if SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL.startswith("sqlite"):
    connect_args = {"check_same_thread": False}
else:
    connect_args = {}

engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args=connect_args)
```

## Session Management
The `SessionLocal` is defined using SQLAlchemy's `sessionmaker`, which is configured to not autocommit or autoflush by default. This ensures that transactions are handled explicitly.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
```

### Context Manager for Sessions
A context manager named `Session` is provided to facilitate session handling. It ensures that sessions are properly closed after use, preventing potential memory leaks or database locks.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def Session():
    session = SQLModelSession(engine)
    try:
        yield session
    finally:
        session.close()
```

## Usage Example
To use the session context manager, you can wrap your database operations within the `Session` context. This ensures that the session is properly managed and closed after the operations are complete.

```python
with Session() as session:
    # Perform database operations here
    pass
```

## Logging
The module uses the `CLIClient` to emit a log message when connecting to the database, providing visibility into the database connection process.

```python
from concrete.clients import CLIClient
CLIClient.emit(f'Connecting to database at {SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL}')
```
