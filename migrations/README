Generic single-database configuration.### Module: Generic Single-Database Configuration

#### Overview
This module provides a streamlined approach to configuring a single database instance for applications. It is designed to simplify the setup process while ensuring that all necessary parameters are correctly defined for optimal performance and security.

#### Configuration Parameters
- **Database Type**: Specify the type of database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- **Host**: The hostname or IP address of the database server. Default is `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port number on which the database server is listening. Default values are typically `3306` for MySQL and `5432` for PostgreSQL.
- **Database Name**: The name of the database to connect to.
- **Username**: The username used to authenticate with the database.
- **Password**: The password associated with the provided username.
- **Connection Pooling**: Options to enable or disable connection pooling, which can improve performance by reusing database connections.

#### Usage
To utilize this module, ensure that all configuration parameters are set correctly in your applicationâ€™s configuration file. The module will handle the connection to the database and provide methods for executing queries and transactions.

#### Error Handling
The module includes built-in error handling to manage common database connection issues, such as:
- Invalid credentials
- Database not found
- Connection timeouts

In case of an error, the module will log the error details and provide a user-friendly message to assist in troubleshooting.

#### Best Practices
- Always use environment variables to store sensitive information such as database credentials.
- Regularly update the database configuration to reflect any changes in the database server or application requirements.
- Monitor database performance and adjust connection pooling settings as necessary to optimize resource usage.
