Module Functionality: This module is responsible for managing database migrations using Alembic. It defines the upgrade and downgrade functions that are executed when applying or reverting migrations, respectively. The upgrade function is intended to implement changes to the database schema, while the downgrade function reverts those changes if necessary.

Key Components:
- **Imports**: The module imports necessary libraries such as `sqlmodel`, `alembic`, and `sqlalchemy` to facilitate database operations and migrations.
- **Revision Identifiers**: The module includes revision identifiers that are crucial for tracking the migration history. These identifiers help in managing the order of migrations and dependencies between them.
- **Upgrade Function**: This function is where the schema changes are defined. It can include operations such as creating tables, adding columns, or modifying existing structures.
- **Downgrade Function**: This function is used to revert the changes made in the upgrade function. It ensures that the database can be rolled back to a previous state if needed.

Usage: This module should be used in conjunction with Alembic's migration commands to apply or revert database changes as part of the application's deployment process. It is essential for maintaining the integrity and versioning of the database schema.
