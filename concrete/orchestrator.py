        List, in natural language, only the essential code components needed to fulfill the user's request.
    
        Your response must:
        1. Include only core components.
        2. Put each new component on a new line (not numbered, but conceptually sequential).
        3. Focus on the conceptual steps of specific code elements or function calls
        4. Be comprehensive, covering all necessary components
        5. Use technical terms appropriate for the specific programming language and framework.
        6. Naturally sequence components, so that later components are dependent on previous ones. 
        
        Important:
        - Assume all dependencies are already installed but not imported.
        - Do not include dependency installations.
        - Focus solely on the code components needed to implement the functionality.
        - NEVER provide code example
        - ALWAYS ensure all necessary components are present

        [Natural language specification of the specific code component or function call]
